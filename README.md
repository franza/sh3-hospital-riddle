Solution to the Silent Hill 3 hospital riddle (2nd floor)

Riddle description:
-------------------

<pre>
The first is larger than second;
the second twice the third;
the third smaller than the first;
the fourth is half the first.

Four of the numbers 
are not repeated
Three are not in the top row
Two are not in the right row
One of the numbers is the final key
</pre>

It seems that this puzzle has a trick: 'Two are not in the right row' but it seems that other two may be in right row.
So I won't actually pay attention to this statement (since the answer is **8634** it is really confusing).
